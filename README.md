Anything to make my life easier

# CONTENT
- install_gecko  install script for the gecko webdriver, it's a huge pain otherwise
- temp.sh Script to be ran on a terminal window to get live temperature readings, sort of neat
- vivado.sh Script to ubstall Debian dependencies (not officially supported OS btw) to not have to abort install at final step and lose sanity (3 hour try periods bc it doesn't cache downloaded files apparently)
